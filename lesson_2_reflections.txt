What happens after initialization: A new empty repository is created,
in which files or other documents will have to be committed.

Difference staging area: Well this area is different because it serves as
the preparation stage for the commits and serves as a bridge between what you
are working on and will actually be committed. I find it good because it serves
as an assurance that the files you want to commit are actually the intended ones,
giving you a chance to think about the changes you are about to make
in a more thorough fashion
